Acard game is any game that uses playing cards as the primary device with which the game is
played, whether the cards are of a traditional design or speciÔ¨Åcally created for the game
(proprietary). Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A
small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules with
international tournaments being held, but most are folk games whose rules may vary by region,
culture, location or from circle to circle.
